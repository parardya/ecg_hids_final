"""
demo_stream.py
----------------
Simulates a REAL-TIME ECG feed for demo purposes. Instead of generating
all 996 entries at once (like generate_dataset.py), this writes ONE new
entry every few seconds, continuously -- like a live patient monitor.

Randomly mixes in normal readings and attacks, so you can watch the
detection system react to things live during your demo.

Run this in its own terminal window. Leave it running while you show
monitor_bridge.py picking up and reacting to each new entry.
